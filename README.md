# Credit Scoring Model

This project was developed as part of the CodeAlpha internship program. The objective is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a person is a good or bad credit risk.

## Project Objective

To analyze financial data and create a classification model that helps in credit decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset was created manually and is included inside the notebook.

## Model

A machine learning model (such as Logistic Regression) was trained and tested to evaluate credit risk.

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook file using Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell in order to see the output and results.

## Output

The model successfully predicts credit status and gives insights into financial risk assessment.

## Status

Completed
